  안녕하세요! 백엔드 엔지니어 정세희입니다. 프로젝트를 통해 <mark>ERD 설계</mark>부터 <mark>API 구현</mark>, <mark>Cloud 인프라 구축</mark> 등을 경험했습니다.
  
  **모든 작업은 팀과 함께** 한다는 생각을 가지고 프로젝트에 임했습니다. 이를 위해 제가 맡은 작업 외에 팀원이 힘들어하는 부분 등, 모르는 것에 대한 학습을 두려워하지 않고 제가 도울 수 있는 것에는 주저하지 않았습니다.
  또한, **개발 프로세스 지속적으로 개선**하여 완성도 및 효율 향상을 위해 고민합니다.
  
  최근엔 개발 역량을 향상시키기 위해 가독성과 재사용성이 높은 코드를 작성하는 데에 집중하고 있습니다. 또한 마무리된 프로젝트라도 리팩토링하여 개선해 보는 작업과 더불어 **담당하지 않았던 부분에 대한 학습도 병행**하고 있습니다.

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
